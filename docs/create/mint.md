### WebUI

The NFT minting interface can be accessed on the Upstreet frontpage by clicking the mint leaf in the top left corner. You can also go directly to it via: https://upstreet.ai/mint.

Once here, you can upload the file or URL to the file of what you wish to mint then add a title + description.

You can optionally choose to set the NFT to be non-transferable, meaning there's no secondary market capability for it. This is useful for personal assets or those which restrict redistribution.
